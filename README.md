# 6502

This is my Ben Eater (https://eater.net/6502) inspired 6502 breadboard project.  This is a hobby project, my interests are learning how the 65c02 hardware works and learning some assembly programming.

Some of my divergences from the BE6502 project to date include:
* Clock speed 3Mhz.
* 4-Bit mode for the 1602A LCD Module.
* Using W65C22 T1 timer to add delay for LCD module setup time.
